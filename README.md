##  Results
- Prophet was able to capture seasonality and trends in avocado prices.
- Here are sample outputs from the forecasting step:
 ![Forecast Plot](forecast.jpg)

- Black dots â†’ actual avocado prices from the dataset (historical data up to 2018).
- Blue line â†’ Prophetâ€™s forecasted values.
- Light blue shaded area â†’ uncertainty interval (confidence range).
- Since the dataset ends in 2018, everything after that date is purely the modelâ€™s prediction rather than real observations.

 ![Trends & Seasonality](components.jpg)

 - Trend â€“ the long-term direction of avocado prices.
- Y-axis: trend (price level)
- X-axis: ds (time in years)
- Yearly Seasonality â€“ repeating patterns within a year.
- Y-axis: effect of seasonality on price.
- X-axis: day of year (January â†’ December).
This shows when prices typically rise (e.g., summer) and when they fall (e.g., winter).

# ðŸ¥‘ Predicting Avocado Prices Using Facebook Prophet

- This project forecasts weekly retail avocado prices using Facebook Prophet.
- The dataset contains 2018 weekly retail scan data for Hass avocados, collected from retailersâ€™ cash registers across the United States.
  
##  Dataset Description

- The dataset only includes Hass avocados (no greenskins).
- The Average Price is per avocado unit, even if sold in bags.
  
## Key Columns:
- Date â€“ Date of observation
- AveragePrice â€“ Average price of a single avocado
- Type â€“ Conventional or organic
- Year â€“ Year of observation
- Region â€“ City or region of observation
- Total Volume â€“ Total avocados sold
- 4046, 4225, 4770 â€“ Volume by PLU codes
  
##  Tools & Libraries

- Pandas â€“ data processing
- NumPy â€“ numerical analysis
- Matplotlib â€“ visualizations
- Seaborn â€“ statistical plots
- Facebook Prophet â€“ forecasting
  
##  Workflow

- Importing Libraries
- Exploring the Dataset â€“ Checking structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
- Preprocessing â€“ Converting dates, aggregating sales, filtering by type/region.
- Visualization â€“ Price trends, organic vs conventional, regional comparisons.
- Forecasting with Prophet â€“ Training and predicting future prices.
- Evaluation â€“ Comparing predicted vs actual prices.
